    "The comparison between this model and the first model reveals that the final model is way superior. All metrics are way more favorable in the case of the final model. The $R^2$ value for the training set is clearly higher and all other parameters given above are significantly smaller, indicating a better description. The visual inspection also suggests a better agreement between predicted and real y values. However, the model still fails to predict the higher values. The higher the value the worse the prediction becomes. The mean residual error is still clearly shifted towards smaller values, which is a little bit more pronounced than for the first model. Overall, this model can be predicted to result in a clear improvement over the first one."
